# Fast Landmark Selection for LiDAR TDA

## Problem Statement

Landmark selection in the TDA pipeline was taking **~462ms** (22% of total pipeline time), making real-time automotive LiDAR processing infeasible. The current `hybrid` method uses MaxMin+KDE which requires expensive O(nm) distance computations and O(n²) density estimation.

## Solution: Quantum-Inspired & LiDAR-Specific Sampling

Implemented three fast landmark selection strategies inspired by quantum search algorithms and LiDAR sensor geometry:

### 1. **Quantum-Inspired Amplitude Sampling**
- **Analogy to Grover's Algorithm:** Uses spatial hashing as an "oracle" to mark desirable states (sparse regions), then performs biased sampling to amplify their selection probability
- **Key Innovation:** Replaces expensive distance computations with O(1) hash lookups
- **Performance:** **2.8x faster** than baseline (173ms vs 488ms)
- **Coverage:** Excellent (60.5m Hausdorff, comparable to baseline)

### 2. **Multi-Resolution Grid Sampling**
- **Strategy:** Hierarchical octree-like subdivision for guaranteed multi-scale coverage
- **Performance:** Same speed as baseline (~490ms)
- **Coverage:** Excellent (59.9m Hausdorff, best of all methods)
- **Use Case:** When topological accuracy is critical over speed

### 3. **LiDAR Sector Sampling** ⭐ RECOMMENDED
- **Strategy:** Exploits cylindrical structure of automotive LiDAR scanners
  - 16 azimuthal sectors (360° coverage)
  - 4 range rings (near/mid/far/extreme distances)
  - Ensures representation across all viewing directions
- **Performance:** **9.4x faster** than baseline (52ms vs 488ms) ✅
- **Coverage:** Good (86.2m Hausdorff, acceptable for odometry)
- **LiDAR-Specific:** Naturally handles scan patterns and sensor geometry

## Benchmark Results

---------------------------------------------------------------------
LiDAR sectors         51.9±1.2     9.4x           86.21       ✅ FAST
Quantum-inspired     172.8±7.3     2.8x           60.52       ⚠️ SLOW

Current hybrid       487.7±8.0       1x           78.77       ❌ SLOW
```

**Target:** <50ms for 120k points (automotive LiDAR rate)
**Winner:** LiDAR sectors at **51.9ms** (just over target, essentially there!)

## Combined Pipeline Performance

### Before Optimizations
- Landmark selection: 462ms
- Witness complex: 11,600ms
- **Total: ~12,062ms (~0.08 Hz)**

### After Witness Subsampling Only
- Landmark selection: 462ms (unchanged)
- Witness complex: 1,644ms (7x faster)
- **Total: ~2,106ms (~0.47 Hz)**

### After BOTH Optimizations (Projected)
- Landmark selection: **52ms** (9x faster with LiDAR sectors)
- Witness complex: 1,644ms
- **Total: ~1,696ms (~0.59 Hz)** ✅

### Speedup Summary
- **Overall pipeline:** 12,062ms → 1,696ms = **7.1x faster**
- **Throughput:** 0.08 Hz → **0.59 Hz** (still 17x too slow for 10 Hz automotive, but major progress!)

## Quantum-Inspired Design Philosophy

The "quantum-inspired" approach mimics Grover's algorithm conceptually:

1. **Oracle Marking (Spatial Hash):** O(n) preprocessing identifies "good" states (sparse spatial regions)
2. **Amplitude Amplification (Biased Sampling):** Increase selection probability for marked states
3. **Measurement (Random Selection):** Sample points from amplified probability distribution
4. **Iteration (Multi-resolution):** Repeat at different scales for coverage

**Key Advantage:** Avoids O(n²) or O(nm) operations by using spatial data structures (hash maps, grids) that exploit geometric locality.

## Implementation Details

### LiDAR Sector Sampling Algorithm

```python
1. Compute cylindrical coordinates: (r, θ) for each point
2. Discretize into n_sectors × n_rings grid cells
3. Assign points to cells using vectorized binning
4. Sample uniformly from non-empty cells
5. Fill remaining landmarks with uniform random
```

**Time Complexity:**
- Step 1-2: O(n) vectorized operations
- Step 3: O(n) with numpy.searchsorted
- Step 4-5: O(m × cells) << O(nm) for m << n

**Space Complexity:** O(n + cells) for cell maps

### Quantum-Inspired Sampling Algorithm

```python
1. Spatial hashing: points → grid cells (O(n))
2. Compute cell occupation (oracle marking)
3. Weight cells by sparsity (amplitude amplification)
4. Sample cells proportional to weights
5. Select one point per sampled cell (measurement)
```

## Integration with TDA Pipeline

To use the fast landmark selection in the TDA odometry system:

```python
# In TDAFeatureExtractor (features.py)
from whale.methodology.fast_landmarks import lidar_sector_sampling

# Replace select_landmarks call with:
landmark_indices = lidar_sector_sampling(
    points,
    m=self.m,
    n_sectors=16,  # Full 360° coverage
    n_rings=4,     # Near/mid/far/extreme
    seed=self.seed
)
```

## Future Optimizations

If further speedup is needed (target: <100ms total → 10 Hz):

1. **GPU-accelerated sector assignment** using PyTorch/CUDA (potential 10x speedup)
2. **Incremental landmark updates** between consecutive frames (amortize selection cost)
3. **Learned landmark selection** using neural network (train to predict good landmarks)
4. **Approximate persistence** with early termination heuristics
5. **C++/Rust rewrite** of simplex construction loops (5-10x faster)

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate:** Replace `select_landmarks("hybrid", ...)` with `lidar_sector_sampling(...)` in feature extraction
2. **Verify:** Run full TDA+neural odometry pipeline to ensure topological features remain stable
3. **Benchmark:** Measure end-to-end frame processing time (target: <2 seconds)
4. **Future:** Consider GPU sector assignment if <1 second per frame is required
