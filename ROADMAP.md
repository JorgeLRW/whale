# Whale Roadmap

## 0.2 (Shipped 2025-10-09)

- **AI-ready persistence summaries**: delivered `whale.ai` helpers and toggleable fast/regular witness workflows.
- **Package polish**: prepped the 0.2.0 PyPI release and documented the AI optional extra.
- **Repository tidy**: archived legacy workspaces while keeping artifacts accessible.

## 0.3 (Next minor release)

- **Notebook refresh**: add parameter exploration widgets to the Colab demo and include the point-cloud benchmark workflow.

## 0.4

- **Packaging polish**: promote the `whale-tda` package to PyPI (post-TestPyPI validation) and collect install feedback.
- **Performance profiling**: integrate optional GPU-accelerated nearest-neighbour search via FAISS/HNSWLib switches.
- **CLI ergonomics**: add `whale` console entry point with subcommands for `deep-dive`, `fast`, and `pointcloud` flows.
- **Dataset registry**: provide friendly manifests and helper scripts for additional public MRI datasets (ABIDE, OASIS).

## 1.0

- **Full reproducibility bundles**: container images for every benchmark configuration and a Makefile to run them.
- **Visualization UI**: lightweight dashboard for interactive persistence diagram exploration.
- **Community governance**: expand maintainer group, document voting procedures, and introduce a technical steering committee if contributor base grows.
