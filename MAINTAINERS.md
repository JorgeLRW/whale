## Responsibilities

- Curate the roadmap, triage issues, and review pull requests.

- Ensure the Code of Conduct is enforced and mediation requests are handled promptly.

## Release cadence

- **Patch releases**: As needed for hot fixes (security, regression, broken build).
- **Pre-releases**: Optional beta tags before major API changes.

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md#release-process) for detailed release steps.

## Becoming a maintainer

Contributors who consistently deliver high-quality changes, respond to review feedback, and help with community support can be nominated as maintainers. Nominees are confirmed by the existing maintainers via agreement recorded in an issue or pull request thread.

## Stepping down

If you need to pause or relinquish maintainer duties, open an issue labelled `governance` so we can update this document and delegate responsibilities.
